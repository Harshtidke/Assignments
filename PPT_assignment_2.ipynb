    "Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2),..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:\n",
