    "Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi],\n",
    "determine if a person could attend all meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Sort the intervals based on the start time in ascending order.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the sorted intervals starting from the second interval: \n",
    "   - Compare the start time of the current interval with the end time of the previous interval.\n",
    "   - If the start time of the current interval is less than or equal to the end time of the previous interval, return false (there is an overlap).\n",
    "3. If no overlaps are found, return true (the person can attend all meetings).\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def canAttendMeetings(intervals):\n",
    "    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort intervals based on start time\n",
    "    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n",
    "        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:\n",
    "            return False  # Overlapping intervals\n",
    "    return True  # No overlaps found\n",
    "```\n",
    "TC = O(n log n) **The algorithm sorts the intervals, which takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of intervals.**\n",
