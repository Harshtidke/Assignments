    "For a stream of integers, implement a data structure that checks if the last `k` integers parsed in the stream are **equal** to `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the **DataStream** class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DataStream(int value, int k)` Initializes the object with an empty integer stream and the two integers `value` and `k`.\n",
    "- `boolean consec(int num)` Adds `num` to the stream of integers. Returns `true` if the last `k` integers are equal to `value`, and `false` otherwise. If there are less than `k` integers, the condition does not hold true, so returns `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Input`\n",
    "[\"DataStream\", \"consec\", \"consec\", \"consec\", \"consec\"]\n",
    "[[4, 3], [4], [4], [4], [3]]\n",
    "`Output`\n",
    "[null, false, false, true, false]\n",
    "\n",
    "`Explanation`\n",
    "DataStream dataStream = new DataStream(4, 3); //value = 4, k = 3\n",
    "dataStream.consec(4); // Only 1 integer is parsed, so returns False.\n",
    "dataStream.consec(4); // Only 2 integers are parsed.\n",
    "                      // Since 2 is less than k, returns False.\n",
    "dataStream.consec(4); // The 3 integers parsed are all equal to value, so returns True.\n",
    "dataStream.consec(3); // The last k integers parsed in the stream are [4,4,3].\n",
    "                      // Since 3 is not equal to value, it returns False.\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty queue to store the last k integers.\n",
    "2. Store the given value and k in class variables.\n",
    "3. Implement the consec method:\n",
    "   - Enqueue the given num to the queue.\n",
    "   - Check if the size of the queue is less than k.\n",
    "     - If true, return false since the condition cannot be satisfied.\n",
    "   - Check if the size of the queue is equal to k.\n",
    "     - If true, iterate through the queue and compare each element with the value.\n",
    "       - If any element is not equal to the value, return false.\n",
    "       - If all elements are equal to the value, return true.\n",
    "   - If the size of the queue is greater than k, dequeue the front element from the queue.\n",
    "   - Repeat step 4 for the remaining elements in the queue.\n",
    "   - Return false if the loop completes without returning true.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "class DataStream:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value, k):\n",
