    "#### Solution:\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Create an array stack to store the potential candidate for the middle element of the pattern.\n",
    "2. Create a variable s3 and set it to negative infinity. This will be used to track the maximum value of the third element of the pattern.\n",
    "3. Iterate over the elements of nums from right to left:\n",
    "   - If the current element nums[i] is greater than s3, return True as we have found a valid 132 pattern.\n",
    "   - While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is less than nums[i], update s3 to the maximum value between s3 and the top element of the stack, and pop the top element from the stack.\n",
    "   - Push nums[i] onto the stack.\n",
    "4. If the loop completes without finding a valid 132 pattern, return False.\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find132pattern(nums):\n",
    "    stack = []\n",
    "    s3 = float('-inf')\n",

    "        if nums[i] > s3:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "\n",
    "        while stack and nums[i] > stack[-1]:\n",
    "            s3 = max(s3, stack.pop())\n",
    "\n",
    "        stack.append(nums[i])\n",
