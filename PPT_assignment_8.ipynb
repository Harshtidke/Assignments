    "# Question 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings s and goal, return true *if you can swap two letters in* s *so the result is equal to* goal*, otherwise, return* false*.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in \"abcd\" results in \"cbad\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** s = \"ab\", goal = \"ba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** true\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get \"ba\", which is equal to goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Initialize two lists, mismatch and indices, to store the mismatched characters and their corresponding indices.\n",
    "2. Iterate over each index i and character c in s:\n",
    "   - If c is not equal to the character at the same index in goal, append c to mismatch and i to indices.\n",
    "3. If the length of mismatch is 0, return True since there are no mismatches.\n",
    "4. If the length of mismatch is not equal to 2, return False since we can only swap two characters.\n",
    "5. Check if the characters at the indices stored in indices in s and goal are equal after swapping:\n",
    "   - If they are equal, return True.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, return False.\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def buddyStrings(s, goal):\n",
    "    if len(s) != len(goal):\n",
    "        return False\n",

    "            mismatch.append(c)\n",
    "            indices.append(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if len(mismatch) == 0:\n",
