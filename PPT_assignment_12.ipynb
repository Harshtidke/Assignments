For example, if given linked list is 1->2->**3**->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5.If there are **even** nodes, then there would be **two middle** nodes, we need to delete the second middle element.

    "Given two linked lists, insert nodes of second list into first list at alternate positions of first list.\n",
    "For example, if first list is 5->7->17->13->11 and second is 12->10->2->4->6, the first list should become 5->12->7->10->17->2->13->4->11->6 and second list should become empty. The nodes of second list should only be inserted when there are positions available. For example, if the first list is 1->2->3 and second list is 4->5->6->7->8, then first list should become 1->4->2->5->3->6 and second list to 7->8.\n",
